<p>Make it Work criticizes the statement 'Everybody can be a Graphic Designer' and how the word “graphic” fails to accurately describe the design solutions that we create. The word “graphic” seems to refer primarily to pictures and images — not the strategies, concepts, words, sound, animation or any other immersive experiences we may choose to include in the design solutions we produce. We are no longer Graphic Designers, we are Visual Communication Designers.</p>

<p>We are treated like we're human computers. We are expected to automatically work, solve problems and create.  But we cannot shut off our intuition, creativity - our humanity. We, Make it Work, will work with a fixed working method so we will have no authority, but still may because of our independency within the working method.</p>

<p>We are creating an archive of tags by googling twitter trending topics and we archive these tags on our website. These tags will be our data, which we'll work with. By using random elements rather than systematic elements we eliminate the need to keep track of values that have been tried before. It's not a statement we want to make but our way of working criticizes and reflects up on the here and now, also in our field of work. </p>
